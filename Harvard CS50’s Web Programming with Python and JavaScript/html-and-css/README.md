## HTML and CSS

### HTML - HyperText Markup Language
HTML is used to describe the structure of the page. We can think about an HTML page in terms of a tree like structure that we call DOM (Document Object Model). DOM describes how all of HTML elements are related to each other.

### CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
CSS is used to add styles to the HTML
